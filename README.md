# MAUI Lollipop Chart to Visualize Leading Hotel Brands by Inventory Share in India
This sample demonstrates how to create a MAUI [Lollipop Chart](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui-toolkit/cartesian-charts/column) using SfCartesianChart from Syncfusion Charts to analyze leading hotel brands by inventory share in India.

One of the standout features of the **Lollipop Chart** is its ability to visually differentiate data through distinct markers. For instance, larger markers can represent dominant hotel brands with significant inventory, while smaller markers signify emerging brands with a lesser share. This visualization quickly conveys the distribution of market presence among leading hotel brands.

## Key features of the Syncfusion MAUI Lollipop chart
The key features of the lollipop chart customization include chart features such as chart title, axis customization and tooltip customization.

### Chart title customization:
In the Syncfusion MAUI Chart, the [Title](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui-toolkit/Syncfusion.Maui.Toolkit.Charts.ChartBase.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Toolkit_Charts_ChartBase_Title) property serves as a crucial element for enhancing the overall clarity and context of the chart. This property allows you to define a descriptive title that succinctly conveys the purpose or subject of the visualization, making it easier for users to understand the data being presented.

### Tooltip customization
Syncfusion charts provide robust options for customizing [tooltips](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui-toolkit/cartesian-charts/tooltip#template), enhancing data interactivity and user experience. Tooltips can display detailed information about each data point, making it easier for users to interpret the underlying data. In the example below, we will customize tooltips to display specific metrics, such as inventory share percentages for leading hotel brands.


### Customizing the Series
When creating a Lollipop Chart using a custom Syncfusion [MAUI Column Chart](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui-toolkit/cartesian-charts/column), customization is key to effectively convey your data insights. The custom column series allows you to transform standard columns into visually distinct lollipop markers. By tailoring aspects such as color schemes, marker shapes, and tooltip formatting, you enhance both the chart's aesthetics and its ability to communicate with users. This customization ensures that the data stands out and is presented in a manner that is engaging and easy to interpret, thereby maximizing the chart's informational impact.

After executing these code examples, we will get the output that resembles the following image.
